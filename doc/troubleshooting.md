# üö® Errors, Deprecations & Troubleshooting

Not all errors are the same ‚Äî and not every issue means something is broken.

This card is designed to gracefully handle common errors in your Lovelace configuration or entity state. These are usually minor and expected, and the card will notify you directly in the UI when they occur (for example, a missing entity or invalid value).

However, you might encounter a real bug ‚Äî something unexpected that breaks functionality and requires further investigation. That‚Äôs where troubleshooting comes in.

## ‚ùó Error handling

This card includes error handling to prevent visual issues and ensure the UI
stays clean and stable. We handle two main categories of errors in the card:

1. **Configuration Errors**
    These occur when the card is incorrectly set up in the Lovelace config.
    Examples:

    - Missing entity ID
    - Invalid or unsupported attributes
    - Incorrect min/max values

2. **Runtime Errors (Entity State Issues)**
    These happen while the card is running and are related to the entity‚Äôs
    current state. Examples:
    - Entity is not found, unavailable or offline

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated Options

Over time, some configuration options have been deprecated in favor of more flexible or clearer alternatives.
While the card tries to maintain backward compatibility, these options may stop working in future releases.

In the development of this card, we strive to avoid breaking changes as much as possible. When such changes are unavoidable, we do our best to support
and guide users through the transition.

In this context, we have two types of deprecated options:

- **Removed**: These were removed to prevent duplication and potential conflicts with the new system.
  It was important to remove them for stability reasons.
- **Deprecated** but still active options: These options may have been used in many different cards, and migrating them requires reviewing the configurations
  of all those cards. Therefore, we allow time before disabling them, provide a system to detect if you are affected, and will remove them later.

| Option / Value     | Status         | Replacement / Recommended Action | Since version | Current Behavior           |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `navigate_to`      | **Removed**    | Use `tap_action: navigate`       | `v1.2.0`      | Ignored, console warning   |
| `show_more_info`   | **Removed**    | Use `tap_action: more-info`      | `v1.2.0`      | Ignored, console warning   |
| `theme: 'battery'` | **Deprecated** | Use `optimal_when_xxx`           | `v1.1.8-11`   | Still works, shows warning |
| `theme: 'cpu'`     | **Deprecated** | Same as above                    | `v1.1.8-11`   | Still works, shows warning |
| `theme: 'memory'`  | **Deprecated** | Same as above                    | `v1.1.8-11`.  | Still works, shows warning |

#### (Optional) roll back

If you recently **updated** the card and the issue started afterward, you can:

- roll back to the **previous working version** using HACS;
- check if a **patch** or fix is already available;
- wait for an update ‚Äî your dashboards will remain intact.
